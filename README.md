## Project Description
It is a personalized notebook application that can be used in daily life. The project includes features such as registration, login, admin panel, adding notes, searching for the desired notes between notes.

## Project testing
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) for more information.

## Technologies used in the project
Using JavaScript library *Reactjs*, based on Nodejs *Expressjs*, and database management with *MongoDb*, I have created a full-stack project with the assistance of technologies such as *Redux*, *MUI*, *cookie*, *jwt*, and *firebase*.

## Project Installation
To begin with, you need to clone the project to your computer. Simply run the following code in your command prompt.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ismailkcbss/NotePadApp.git
```
After cloning the project to your computer, you need to open the command prompt in the directory where you copied the folder. Then, to complete the project installation, you should follow the steps below in sequence.

- ### Frontend Installation

Open the **frontend** folder in the downloaded directory, and click on the folder path above the directory to run the *command prompt*. Then, to install the *node-modules* folder inside the directory, type the following command

```bash
$ npm install
```

After the download is complete, to run our project, type the following command in the same command prompt.

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

You can run the project by typing this command. In some cases, after the download is complete, you may encounter errors due to package versions. In such a situation, you can manually download according to the versions of the packages in the *package.json* file shown below

An example of the command you should type in the command prompt when you are inside the project's main directory for the download process is;
```bash
$ npm install react@18.0.2 --save --force
```
Writing this will assist you in downloading the package.

- ### Backend Installation 

Open the 'backend' folder in the downloaded directory, and click on the folder path above the directory to run the command prompt. Then, to install the **node-modules** folder inside the directory, type the following command

```bash
$ npm install
```

After the download is complete, to run our project, type the following command in the same command prompt
```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```

You can run the project by typing this command. In some cases, after the download is complete, you may encounter errors due to package versions. In such a situation, you can manually download according to the versions of the packages in the package.json file shown below.
